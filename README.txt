To whom it may concern

If the code does not compile/run for any reason, blame Netbeans! I can assure you that my code compiles and runs simulations.
I'd be more than happy to sit in front of you and download my files from the automarker -> copy-paste all my code into text files -> compile them -> run them, if necessary.

Kind regards,
